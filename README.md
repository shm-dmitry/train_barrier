It's a toy for a children :)
I assembled board, its worked.
Known issues:
- schematics/board. I know how to make it better. But current design ok for a toy. I will chabnge it in case of child requested new version :)
- 3D model: train-barrier-cap. But I printed it 5 times, and last version was acceptable, so maybe I will change it later.
- firmware: There are some issue with beeper, I will check it.
